# Ideas

Here we collect ideas, concept and mechanics of the modpack.

## Background Story

The player has crashed onto an abandoned wasteland planet in the middle of a nuclear winter. Without any resources, the player needs to find a way to utilize the remaining scrap scattered around the planet to survive. Furthermore he can't call for help as his radio transmitter got destroyed during the crash-landing. Will he be able to survive this godforsaken adventure? Which dangerous creatures will he encounter? Will he find a way to leave this place?

### Temperature

The player is encouraged to find shelter, because he starts to freeze quite quickly in the cold. Protection from the storm as well as a campfire gives the player warmth for the time being. It also helps to put on warm clothes or eat warm food. If it is possible, the game should try to determine the room temperature. Wind and humidity should also have an influence on the body temperature. The player can freeze to death.

### Nourishment

The player should eat consciously. Since I am not familiar with this, more details will follow later.

The temperature of the food has an influence on the body. In the same way, the taste of the food and variety should play a role. If the player always eats the same food, he will get tired of it over time. Each food item is worth a dynamic appetite.

The player must also drink regularly or he will die of thirst.

Bad or insufficient nutrition will bring negative effects with itself!
